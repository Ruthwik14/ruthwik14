### Welcome to my GitHub Universe! üåå &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Ruthwik14.Ruthwik14&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)

As an experienced data professional, I am skilled in collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), establishing trends and key performance indicators (KPIs), and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

I am proficient in building reports and dashboards and developing predictive models. I have proven expertise in leveraging analytical tools such as Power BI, Python, SQL, advance Excel, macros , VBA and Tableau to enhance business performance, drive decision-making, and achieve strategic goals. I possess strong knowledge in statistics, machine learning, data modeling, ETL, data mining, and data warehousing, and I demonstrate excellent analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills.

With a proven ability in cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder management, I have demonstrated success in improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and sales performance through data-driven solutions.

üîç Currently, I am delving deeper into the realms of strategy consulting and project management, eager to unravel their intricacies and harness their power for innovative solutions. Exploring the latest AI tools can significantly streamline day-to-day tasks, simplify complex processes, and enhance efficiency.
